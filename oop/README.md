# OOP Concepts in JavaScript

This folder demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts for interview preparation:

- `class_object.js`: Basic class and object creation.
- `encapsulation.js`: Encapsulation using private fields/methods.
- `inheritance.js`: Inheritance with subclasses.
- `polymorphism.js`: Polymorphism via method overriding.
- `abstraction.js`: Simulated abstraction (abstract class pattern).
- `composition.js`: Composition as an alternative to inheritance.

Each file contains code and comments to help you understand the concept.
